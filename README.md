# hello-world
Starting my git hub adventure
Student of Computer Systems Engineering Almost finished but the pandemic slowed down the curriculum and killed my motivation for school so i decided to focus on what i want to learn wich is game development.
Have experience with java wich translates to C# so i decided to start learning unity but also started to learn c++ to learn UE and have more oportunities.
With no budget left and no degree but in desperate need of a job my adventure continues...
